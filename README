GenomertiCorr package version history.

1.00
Initial release.
1.01
Documentation improved.
1.02
Now, in the beginning if the core GenometricCorrelation function all the space names in parameters are converted to strings. It fixes strange behavior if the chromosomes.to.proceed is an integer vector.
1.03
Documentation Makefile changed to account for R_HOME. With R 2.13.0, R CMD check runs without warnings.
1.0.4
Version numbers mow compatible with R x.x.x standard. Some changes to documentation. This version is submitted to Bioconductor.
1.0.5
Documentation now can be compiled correctly both in 2.13.0 and in 2.14.0dev: \SweaveOpts{keep.source=FALSE} is added.
1.0.6
Option awhole.only added to GenometricCorrelation. 
Member absolute.inter.reference.distance.data added to the list it returns.
Rd file for GenometricCorrelation refurbished.
1.0.7
All the UCSC URLs to the example data are removed from package.
Documentation spell-checked and improved a bit.
1.0.8
Parameters that allow the user to define his own procedure of the representing point calculation for an interval are added.
1.0.9
Typos in documentation are fixed. 
readTableToIRanges is not exported any more.
It is available as GenometriCorr:::readTableToIRanges
1.0.10
Three options are added to GenometricCorrelation: 
add.chr.as.prefix to treat say '34' and 'chr34' as synonyms; supress.evaluated.length.warning to suppress the warning;
suppress.evaluated.length.warning replaced the typo supress.evaluated.length.warning in 1.1.13
cut.all.over.length to remove overlegnth data rather that to generate error. 
Some bugs fixed.
1.0.11
MapRangesToGenomicIntervals added to the package
GenometricCorrelation now works with GRanges as well as with RangedData
Bugs fixed
showTkProgressBar option added to GenometricCorrelation
Documentation improved
1.0.12
Old parameter names (rangesA and rangesB) in GenometricCorrelation are changed to query and reference.
Configuration class GenometriCorrConfig 
1.0.13
GenometriCorrResult class apeared
GenometriCorrConfig now can do run.config with partial-written configs
1.0.14
Prepare major release
plotgcr(GenometriCorrResult) changed to plot
run.config works with mapping
run.config accepts now: filename, object (GRanges, etc) or object name as parameter
visualise added; it gives other GenometriCorrResult visual representation
Documentation improved
1.0.15
config lines are parsed to their type
bed.like.with.header format added
a lot of bugfixes
visualize improved
1.0.16
visualise and plot use the same paper size
documenation improved
1.1.0
Documentation now is more reaasonable.
The diagnostics is now less depressive: 
  all the 'So what?' is now 'It's all lost!'
1.1.1
Sweave (class part) improvement
1.1.2
Galaxy example fixed. Thanks to Xuebing Wu <wuxbl@mit.edu>
1.1.3
strsplit() usage in GenometriCorrResult fixed.
1.1.4
mapping of plot() refined
1.1.5
visualize() fixed
1.1.6
USCS typo removes from all files
GenometricCorrelation is now GenometriCorrelation (GenometricCorrelation deprecated)
/inst/tests moved to /inst/extdata
Documentation enriched
plot(GenometriCorrResult) is renamed to graphical.report(GenometriCorrResult)
1.1.7
CITATION now shows PLOS Comp Bio, 2012, 5(8)
1.1.8
import from rtracklayer now requires asRangedData=TRUE
thanks to Mike Parfenov from Harvard and to Svetlana Vinigradova from MSU
1.1.9
visualize now use red-white-blue color scheme, the old one can be called by style=rainbow
graphical.report format improved
graphical.report default file name creation improved
GenometricCorrelation help error (awhole.only options were swapped) fixed.
graphical.report error tried to refer to obsoleted reference.middles in GenometriCorrResult - fixed
Thanks to Mike Parfenov from Harvard and to Youri Kravatsky from IMB RAS
relative.ecdf.deviation.area returned to list of obligatory values
help for package now reflects classes
the same in Wizard and in Galaxy integration fixed: we called plot() instead of graphical.report()
graphical.report test whether keep.distributions is defined rather than to start an error
Wizard is consistent with current dir structure
1.1.10
The rtracklayer's import now returns GRanges only, so a lot of things were changed
vignettes are move to vignettes
1.1.11
A lot of changes to be compliant with Bioconductor
R CMD CHECK passes with no warnings
We use seqlenthgs of TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene in the examples
1.1.12
Strange cycles are replaced with findOverlaps. ~10 times faster.
1.1.13
A lot of typos in documentation fixed.
Starting and trailing spaces are now trimmed in configuration file values and tags.
MapRangesToGenomicIntervals rewritten. Two more bugs removed. 
Thanks to Ruth McCole from Harvard.
$jaccard.intersection.null.list added to the result is keep.distribution=TRUE. 
Thanks to Promita Bose from Memorial Sloan Kettering 
1.1.14
Some bugs in vignette
We add the 'scaled.absolute.min.distance.sum' to the result even if there is no permutation test on it.
Thanks to mikhail.dozmorov from Virginia Commonwealth University
1.1.15
Bug in projection test fixed
added query.coverage and reference.coverage to the GenometriCorrResult
1.1.16
Oveflow bug in projection test fixed, 
thanks to Tyler Funnell from BCCRC, Vancouver

thanks to Meharji Arumilli from Helsinki University, Finland
the correct expected curve for absolute.disdances added to graphical.report() 
the documentation updated
1.1.18
If the map space is not normalized, the mapping code normalizes it and warns instead of error.
Thanks to Alla and Vanja from VIGG.
Doc links fixed.
An empty GenometriCorrResult produced error on show(), fixed.
awhole.only=TRUE if it is not set explicitely and if the mapping is on
1.1.19
permut.number parameter is added. It is a common default for all the three permutation numbers
1.1.20
Chromosome lenght evaluation was with a bug. Fixed.
Thanks to Ania and Vanja from VIGG.
